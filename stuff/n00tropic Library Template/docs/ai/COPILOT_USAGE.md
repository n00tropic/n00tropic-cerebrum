# Copilot Usage (LLMs in Development)

**We love good assistants; we verify everything.**

## Allowed

- Boilerplate scaffolding, test stubs, refactor suggestions, docs.
- Generating proposals we then review and refine.

## Not allowed

- Blind pasting into sensitive paths.
- Shipping code without human review and tests.

## Hygiene

- Preface prompts with project context and our standards.
- Add a PR note if AI assisted materially.
- Encapsulate AI‑generated code in small, testable units.
