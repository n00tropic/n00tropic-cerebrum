# n00tropic Project Template

> **Frank, fast, and frontier‑grade.** Drop this into a new repo to start on the right foot.

This template gives you a battle‑tested `/docs` library, quality gates, and a shared language for building OSS‑first, agent‑enhanced, evergreen software.

## Quick start

- Skim `/docs/project/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` and fill in essentials.
- Capture your first decision in `/docs/architecture/ADRs/ADR-0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`.
- Sketch the system in `/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` (C4: context→containers→components).
- Wire CI to enforce `/docs/quality/QUALITY_GATES.md`.
- Read `/docs/ai/COPILOT_USAGE.md` before you let an LLM near your codebase.

## Why this exists

We want every project to be **consistent, modular, and pluggable**. If it ships from n00tropic, it should:

- be OSS‑first (cloud optional),
- respect DRY/YAGNI,
- keep dependencies evergreen,
- prioritise Developer Experience,
- and treat code quality like a non‑negotiable.

> “Garbage in, garbage out” is not a vibe. Build clean, measure often, improve relentlessly.
