# Codex configuration template
# NOTE: Codex looks for this file at ~/.codex/config.toml.
# You can keep this version in-repo for reference and copy relevant parts to your user config.

# Docs:
# - Codex CLI overview & install: https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/
# - Local configuration options (model, approvals, sandbox, profiles): https://developers.openai.com/codex/local-config
# - MCP servers (connect docs/tools safely): https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/

# Default options (used if no profile is specified)
model = "gpt-5-codex"             # switch in CLI with: codex --model gpt-5-codex
model_reasoning_effort = "medium" # try "high" for complex tasks
approval_policy = "auto"          # ask before leaving workspace or using network
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"  # read/write inside repo; no home/root writes

[shell_environment_policy]
include_only = ["PATH", "HOME"] # keep the surface area small

# Profiles let you switch behaviours quickly: codex --profile offline-strict
[profiles.offline-strict]
model = "gpt-5-codex"
model_reasoning_effort = "medium"
approval_policy = "on-request"    # pause more often
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

[profiles.full-access]
model = "gpt-5-codex"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
approval_policy = "auto"
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access" # CAUTION: use sparingly

# Example MCP servers — enable targeted tools/context safely.
# Add via CLI:  codex mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
[mcp_servers.context7]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]

# Example: Playwright browser MCP (HTTP server form)
# [mcp_servers.playwright]
# url = "https://mcp.playwright.dev/mcp"
