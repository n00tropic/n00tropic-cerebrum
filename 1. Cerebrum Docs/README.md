# Cerebrum Documentation Hub

This directory captures workspace-level knowledge that sits above any single repository. Use it to document governance, cross-repo automation, and decisions that affect multiple generators at once.

└── ADR/                      # Architecture Decision Records for the workspace
```

## Using This Folder

1. **Workspace ADRs** – Store cross-cutting architectural decisions under `ADR/`. Follow the naming pattern `ADR-XXX-title.md` (three-digit sequence).
2. **Indexes** – Reference repository-specific ADR indices when a decision spans multiple repos so readers know where to dive deeper.
3. **Local Guidance** – Add any future quick-start guides, release checklists, or workspace automation notes here instead of the individual repos.
4. **Release Manifests** – `releases.yaml` is generated by `../.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-release.sh` and tracks the tags bundled into the latest workspace drop.
5. **Toolchain Notes** – When runtimes change, capture the decision here and update `../n00-cortex/data/toolchain-manifest.json` alongside affected ADRs.
