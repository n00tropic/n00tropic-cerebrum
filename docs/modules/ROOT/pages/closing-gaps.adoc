xref:++../1. Cerebrum Docs/ADR/ADR-006-planner-and-docs-gap-closure.md++ captures the decision to finish the remaining work from temp-doc and temp-doc-2. This page tracks execution status and links the workstreams to n00-horizons experiments/jobs.

== Workstreams

[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Workstream | Deliverables | Tracking
| Planner telemetry surfaces | Publish n00-school planner dataset + dashboards, auto-attach plans to briefs, update AGENT_E2E + control panel with planner status. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/planner-telemetry.adoc++[] (project-control-panel capability now runs `scripts/generate-experiment-plans.sh` and renders DRY/YAGNI tables from `.dev/automation/artifacts/plans/horizons-*.json`).
| Antora & Typesense completion | Convert remaining Markdown (n00tropic policies, n00-school learning logs, n00plicate quality/security/testing guides), document remote Typesense reindex, mark tracker ✅. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/antora-typesense-completion.adoc++[] (control panel consumes `docs/search/logs/typesense-reindex-*.log[.json]` so Typesense freshness is machine-readable).
| Control-panel upgrade | Surface planner metrics, Typesense validation status, migration progress in control-panel doc and dashboards. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/control-panel-upgrade.adoc++[] (autogenerated Markdown now includes planner telemetry + search health before landing in Antora). Jobs: `job-control-panel-dashboard-sync`, `job-search-freshness-guard`.

== Next actions

. Track the remaining work via n00-horizons jobs:
.. `job-control-panel-dashboard-sync` – Mirror control-panel telemetry inside the dashboard UI.
.. `job-planner-trend-export` – Export DRY/YAGNI trend dataset to n00-school.
.. `job-search-freshness-guard` – Enforce Typesense freshness via Danger/CI.
. Schedule nightly `n00t school.trainingRun planner-v1 --dataset planner-v1` once the telemetry backlog grows and publish the DRY/YAGNI trend to dashboards.

Update this page as milestones complete.
