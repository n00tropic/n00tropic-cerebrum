xref:++../1. Cerebrum Docs/ADR/ADR-006-planner-and-docs-gap-closure.md++ captures the decision to finish the remaining work from temp-doc and temp-doc-2. This page tracks execution status and links the workstreams to n00-horizons experiments/jobs.

== Workstreams

[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Workstream | Deliverables | Tracking
| Planner telemetry surfaces | Publish n00-school planner dataset + dashboards, auto-attach plans to briefs, update AGENT_E2E + control panel with planner status. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/planner-telemetry.adoc++[] (project-control-panel capability now runs `scripts/generate-experiment-plans.sh` and renders DRY/YAGNI tables from `.dev/automation/artifacts/plans/horizons-*.json`).
| Antora & Typesense completion | Convert remaining Markdown (n00tropic policies, n00-school learning logs, n00plicate quality/security/testing guides), document remote Typesense reindex, mark tracker ✅. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/antora-typesense-completion.adoc++[] (control panel consumes `docs/search/logs/typesense-reindex-*.log[.json]` so Typesense freshness is machine-readable).
| Control-panel upgrade | Surface planner metrics, Typesense validation status, migration progress in control-panel doc and dashboards. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/control-panel-upgrade.adoc++[] (autogenerated Markdown now includes planner telemetry + search health before landing in Antora).

== Next actions

. Surface the same control-panel telemetry (planner + search) inside `n00-dashboard` so PM dashboards mirror the Markdown snapshots.
. Export planner trend data (DRY/YAGNI over time) from `.dev/automation/artifacts/plans/*.json` into the n00-school dataset for richer charts.
. Add a Danger rule that fails docs/brief PRs when the Typesense summary (`docs/search/logs/*.log.json`) is older than 7 days.

Update this page as milestones complete.
