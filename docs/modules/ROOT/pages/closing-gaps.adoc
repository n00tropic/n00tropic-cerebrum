xref:++../1. Cerebrum Docs/ADR/ADR-006-planner-and-docs-gap-closure.md++ captures the decision to finish the remaining work from temp-doc and temp-doc-2. This page tracks execution status and links the workstreams to n00-horizons experiments/jobs.

== Workstreams

[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Workstream | Deliverables | Tracking
| Planner telemetry surfaces | Publish n00-school planner dataset + dashboards, auto-attach plans to briefs, update AGENT_E2E + control panel with planner status. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/planner-telemetry.adoc++[] (see `n00-horizons/scripts/generate-experiment-plans.sh` for deterministic `.plan.md` artefacts).
| Antora & Typesense completion | Convert remaining Markdown (n00tropic policies, n00-school learning logs, n00plicate quality/security/testing guides), document remote Typesense reindex, mark tracker ✅. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/antora-typesense-completion.adoc++[] (logs + JSON summaries under `docs/search/logs/typesense-reindex-*.log[.json]`).
| Control-panel upgrade | Surface planner metrics, Typesense validation status, migration progress in control-panel doc and dashboards. | xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/experiments/control-panel-upgrade.adoc++[] (new sections in xref:++n00-horizons/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/control-panel.adoc++[]).

== Next actions

. Hook `n00-horizons/scripts/generate-experiment-plans.sh` into `project-control-panel.sh` so plan refreshes happen automatically during telemetry snapshots.
. Teach the control-panel/dashboard automation to consume `docs/search/logs/*.log.json` and display search freshness without manual edits.
. Wire planner metric rollups (DRY/YAGNI/conflict trends) into the dashboard automation output in addition to the manual tables.

Update this page as milestones complete.
