The Cerebrum workspace stitches together the repositories that power n00tropic's
platform: changelog automation, documentation, agent workflows, training
curricula, and template generators. Each repository keeps its own release
cadence and tooling, while this workspace supplies shared automation and
alignment.

Schemas published from `n00-cortex` drive automation in `n00-frontiers`, which
then feeds downstream consumers such as `n00plicate` and the shared
documentation set. `n00t` orchestrates the automation surface, while doctrine
(`n00tropic`) and training signals (`n00-school`) complete the feedback loop.

== Repository profiles

=== `1. Cerebrum Docs/`

* *Focus*: Cross-Repo decision records, release manifests, and workspace
 onboarding docs.
* *Key artifacts*: ADRs, `RENOVATE_SETUP.md`, `TRUNK_GUIDE.md`, `releases.yaml`
 (written by automation).
* *Role*: Acts as canonical reference material that other repos cite for shared
 policy.
=== `n00-frontiers/`

* *Mandate*: Authoritative source for software, delivery, and design excellence.
 Defines the standards that every downstream system follows.
* *Output*: Templates, notebooks, CLI tooling, and the quality bar for
 frontier-grade work.
* *Cadence*: Updated frequently; every change should be reflected in `docs/`,
 `catalog.json`, and TASKS/ADR tracking.
=== `n00-cortex/`

* *Mandate*: Systematise and enforce the rules issued by `n00-frontiers`.
 Publishes schemas, manifests, and documentation that downstream consumers must
 obey.
* *Output*: JSON Schemas, toolchain manifests, canonical documentation site, and
 reusable templates.
* *Dependency*: Pulls rendered assets and policies from `n00-frontiers` before
 distributing them.
=== `n00tropic/`

* *Mandate*: Organizational handbook and flagship generation engine. Houses
 briefs, discovery artefacts, and generators that translate context into
 scaffolded projects and assets.
* *Output*: Context ingestion, directory/project scaffolding, and operational
 doctrine for every service pillar.
* *Integration*: Feeds `n00t` with briefs and configuration; ensures generated
 artefacts comply with `n00-frontiers` and `n00-cortex`.
=== `n00t/`

* *Mandate*: Agent and automation control center. Discovers capabilities, runs
 workspace scripts, and brokers context between humans, agents, and repos.
* *Output*: MCP host, capability manifest, orchestration UI/CLI.
* *Integration*: Invokes automation scripts and propagates telemetry back to
 `n00-cortex` and `n00-frontiers`.
=== `n00plicate/`

* *Mandate*: Platform-agnostic design asset + CDN generator. Converts design-token
 sources into multi-runtime packages.
* *Output*: Token orchestrator, UI kernel, framework adapters, and reference apps.
* *Integration*: Aligns with `n00-frontiers` design rules and feeds packaged
 assets to `n00tropic` deliverables.
=== `n00-school/`

* *Mandate*: Training center and R&D lab for n00tropic assistants. Develops and
 evaluates pipelines that improve automation quality.
* *Output*: Training datasets, pipelines, evaluation harnesses, and telemetry.
* *Integration*: Capabilities surface through `n00t`; insights loop back into
 `n00-frontiers` standards.
=== `n00-horizons/`

* *Mandate*: Project management, ideation, and strategy hub. Ensures every idea is
 traceable to deliverables and upstream/downstream impacts.
* *Output*: Experiment briefs, GitHub issue/project orchestration, and strategic
 playbooks.
* *Integration*: Operates under the `n00-frontiers` horizon workflow and reports
 impacts to affected repos.
=== `n00clear-fusion/`

* *Mandate*: Ingestion, enrichment, and RAG-friendly export pipelines that
 transform PDFs, Word docs, tabular data, and transcripts into n00t-ready
 training packs.
* *Output*: `corpora/` manifests, `pipelines/` processors, and `exports/` bundles
 that downstream repos (n00-horizons jobs, n00-frontiers templates, n00t
 capabilities) can consume without extra glue code.
* *Integration*: Shares derived assets with `n00-cortex` taxonomies, feeds
 cookiecutters/templates in `n00-frontiers`, and backfills `n00t` capabilities so
 agents can scaffold projects from curated source material.
== Cross-repo release flow

[mermaid] … sequenceDiagram participant Dev as Contributor participant Cortex as
n00-cortex participant Frontiers as n00-frontiers participant Docs as 1.
Cerebrum Docs participant Automation as .dev/automation

Dev->>Cortex: update schemas and manifests Cortex-->>Frontiers: publish new
toolchain rules Dev->>Frontiers: regenerate templates and run sanity checks
Dev->>Automation: run meta-check and trunk sync Automation-->>Docs: write
releases.yaml via workspace-release.sh Docs-->>Dev: document decisions and ADR
updates …

This sequence highlights the typical cadence: adjust policy in `n00-cortex`,
adapt generators in `n00-frontiers`, validate via automation, and record the
outcome in shared documentation.

== Automation toolkit

Automation scripts live under `.dev/automation/scripts/` and surface through the
`n00t` capability manifest.

|=== | Script | Purpose

| `meta-check.sh` | Orchestrates Repo health checks, schema validation, and CVE
scans before publishing changes.

| `refresh-workspace.sh` | Fast-forwards each Repo and updates submodules to
keep local clones aligned.

| `trunk-upgrade.sh` | Runs `trunk upgrade` across repos (supports Repo filters
and extra flags when invoked via capabilities).

| `check-cross-repo-consistency.py` | Ensures toolchain manifests and overrides
remain aligned.

| `workspace-release.sh` | Verifies clean git state and writes `1. Cerebrum
Docs/releases.yaml`.

| `ai-workflows/*` | Phase-specific scripts for the AI-assisted development
workflow surfaced by `n00t`.

| `project-preflight.sh` | Chains capture + GitHub/ERPNext syncs and fails fast
when review cadence, links, or IDs are missing.

| `project-lifecycle-radar.sh` | Emits a JSON radar summarising lifecycle
totals, overdue reviews, and integration gaps for planning.

| `project-control-panel.sh` | Builds `n00-horizons/docs/control-panel.md` so
planning decks link runbooks, radar output, and preflights.

| `scripts/erpnext-run.sh` | Legacy bench shim kept for compatibility; reads
pins from `n00tropic_HQ/12-Platform-Ops/erpnext-docker/.env`, verifies
MySQL/Redis, launches the ERPNext UI, logs telemetry, and runs PM/telemetry
exports once the Docker-managed stack is up.

| `scripts/docker-sync.mjs` | Pulls the latest ERPNext and design-tool docker images,
| updates compose pins, and records the outcome under

| `project-preflight-batch.sh` | Executes preflight across every registry entry
to keep GitHub + ERPNext sync warnings visible.

| `workspace-health.py` | Summarises root + submodule git status, emits
`artifacts/workspace-health.json`, cleans safe untracked files, and syncs
submodules on demand. |===

Run `python CLI.py --help` from the workspace root (or `n00-horizons/CLI.py`,
`n00-frontiers/CLI.py`, etc.) to access curated wrappers around these scripts
for both agents and humans.

Automation executions append telemetry to
`.dev/automation/artifacts/automation/agent-runs.json`, which powers dashboards
and agent insights.

== Formatter guardrails

* *Python format flow*: Every Trunk config runs `isort@7.0.0` before `black@25.x`
 so imports settle before layout styling. If a formatter loop appears, run `trunk
 fmt --filter=isort,black` or `isort . && black .` in the affected repo.
* *isort configuration*: `n00-frontiers/.isort.cfg` pins `profile = black` and
 `line_length = 88`, and the setting is mirrored by the other repos via Trunk
 sync so Black never rewrites imports immediately after isort.
* *Deep dive*: See `n00-school/in-dev-learnings/black-isort-conflicts.md` plus
 `n00-frontiers/docs/quality/formatting-style.md` for the rationale, escalation
 steps, and verification checklist agents should follow when formatters disagree.
* *Automation reminder*: `trunk-upgrade.sh` (and the `python3 CLI.py
 trunk-upgrade` helper) keep formatter versions in lockstep across every Repo, so
 rerun it whenever `isort`/`black` ship compatibility fixes.
== Operating guidelines

* *Plan in public*: Capture cross-Repo decisions in `1. Cerebrum Docs/ADR/` and
 link to repo-specific ADRs.
* *Keep repos pristine*: Use `.dev/` directories for scratch assets and avoid
 committing generated artefacts.
* *Run the workspace maintenance loop*: Follow `1. Cerebrum
 Docs/WORKSPACE_MAINTENANCE.md` (plus the `AI_WORKSPACE_PLAYBOOK.md` companion)
 to run `workspace-health`, `meta-check`, and project preflights before every PR
 or release.
* *Version discipline*: Update `n00-cortex/data/toolchain-manifest.json` first
 when bumping runtimes so Renovate presets and generators stay aligned.
* *Release sequencing*: Tag repos independently, then run `workspace-release.sh`
 to snapshot versions and update documentation.
* *Security hygiene*: Run `pip-audit -r n00-frontiers/requirements.txt` (or rely
 on `meta-check`) before shipping templates.
* *Automation discovery*: Use `n00t/capabilities/manifest.json` to discover
 scripted operations for CLI or MCP clients.
== Workspace filesystem

Operational outputs live in the shared filesystem at `/Volumes/APFS
Space/n00tropic`, organized as:

* `01-Leadership/`: governance, legal, and risk artefacts with links back to
 `n00tropic/01-Leadership`.
* `02-Revenue/`: campaign results, CRM exports, and sales intelligence synced
 from ERPNext.
* `03-Delivery/`: project deliverables, QA evidence, and support transcripts
 tied to ERPNext Projects.
* `04-People/`: HRMS snapshots, onboarding packs, and n00-school evaluation
 summaries.
* `05-Finance-Procurement/`: accounting closes, purchasing approvals, and vendor
 records.
* `06-Innovation-Labs/`: R&D experiment outputs spanning `n00-frontiers`,
 `n00-cortex`, and `n00plicate`.
* `07-Platform-Ops/`: automation runbooks, telemetry, and ERPNext self-hosting
 playbooks.
* `99-Clients/`: per-client deliverables using the `@slug` naming convention.
* `90-Archive/`: immutable exports with checksums for audits.
* `98-Scratchpad/`: temporary drafts purged automatically after 30 days.
== Getting started locally

. Clone the workspace: `+git clone
https://github.com/IAmJonoBo/n00tropic-cerebrum.git && cd n00tropic-cerebrum+`.
. Initialise submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`. . Run
`.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-health.sh --sync-submodules
--publish-artifact --json` (optionally `--clean-untracked`) to ensure submodules
are aligned and to snapshot git state for agents/ci. . Install toolchains per
Repo (Python venv for `n00-frontiers`, Node for `n00-cortex` and `n00t`, pnpm
for `n00plicate`). . Open the multi-root VS Code workspace
(`n00-cortex/generators/n00tropic-cerebrum.code-workspace`). . Run baseline
checks: `./.dev/automation/scripts/meta-check.sh` followed by repo-specific
health commands. . Explore `1. Cerebrum Docs/` for ADRs, Renovate setup, and
onboarding guides.

== Script index

The `script_index.md` file provides an automatically generated, organized
catalog of all scripts across the n00tropic polyrepo. This index is optimized
for agents and developers to locate and understand available scripts.

=== Usage

* *View index*: Open `script_index.md` to browse scripts by category.
* *Update index*: Run `python3 generate_script_index.py` to regenerate the index
 after adding new scripts.
* *Dynamic registration*: New scripts are automatically detected and categorized
 when the index is updated.
The index includes executable files and scripts with common extensions (.sh,
.py, .js, etc.), organized by their containing directory for easy navigation.

By keeping the repos intentionally decoupled yet automation-aware, the Cerebrum
workspace lets contributors evolve generators, docs, and agents without tripping
over each other's toolchains while still sharing a coherent release pulse.

____ ❗️ Don't run `git init` in `/Volumes/APFS Space/n00tropic`. The
organizational root is intentionally non-versioned; all contributions should
