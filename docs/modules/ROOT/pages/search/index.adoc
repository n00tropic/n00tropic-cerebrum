== Modes

* **Offline / local builds**–Lunr indexes are emitted automatically when running
 `pnpm exec antora-playbook.yml`. Confirm `build/site/search-index.js` exists.
* **Production (Algolia DocSearch)**–Option A is active. The DocSearch crawler
 targets the GitHub Pages deployment for `n00-cerebrum`. Keep the
 `docsearch.json` configuration in the Algolia dashboard in sync with any URL
 changes.

== Re-index steps

. Push doc changes to `main` (or a release branch) and wait for `ci/docs.yml` to
finish so GitHub Pages is up-to-date. . Sign in to Algolia DocSearch, select the
`n00-cerebrum` index, and trigger a **manual crawl**. (Automated crawling can be
scheduled once the domain stabilizes.) . Verify the new documents via the
DocSearch preview, then smoke test the in-site search UI.

== Troubleshooting

* If Lunr search returns no hits, delete `build/site` and rebuild to ensure stale
 indexes are removed.
* When Algolia misses fresh content, double-check that pages declare `:page-tags:`
 and `:reviewed:`. Missing attributes are rejected by the crawler.
* For hackable offline experiments, point your browser at `build/site/index.html`
 and inspect the `window.antoraLunrIndex` payload.
