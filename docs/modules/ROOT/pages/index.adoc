The n00 Cerebrum super-repo now owns the Antora playbook for every sibling
workspace. Each submodule will expose its docs component via the shared build so
we can reason about projects, automations, and runbooks from one URL.

== Ecosystem tracker

xref:migration-status.adoc[Open the migration tracker] for task-level detail.
The snapshot below highlights immediate focus:

[cols="1,1,2,"options="header"] |=== | Component | Status | Next action |
n00-cerebrum | ✅ Baseline scaffold merged | Finalize page tagging + CI (this
branch) | n00-frontiers | ⏳ Awaiting repo migration | Mirror this layout and
point start_paths at its docs folder | n00-cortex | ⏳ Awaiting repo migration |
Capture automation specs + tag pipelines via includes | n00t | ⏳ Awaiting repo
migration | Export agent runtime docs to `docs/modules` |===

== Diátaxis cheatsheet

[cols="1,3,"options="header"] |=== | Mode | When to choose it | Tutorial |
Greenfield walk-throughs (e.g., provisioning frontier workspaces). | How-to |
Focused jobs with clear outcomes (e.g., running ERPNext exports). | Reference |
Exhaustive configuration, API schemas, CLI flags. | Explanation | Architecture
notes, ADRs, and rationale. |===

== Living snippets

[source,shell]
----
include::example$scripts/erpnext-run.sh[tags=snippet-erpnext-run]
----

Because snippets are tagged in-source they stay evergreen whenever tests update the files that own the truth.

== Search & MCP

* xref:search/index.adoc[Search + indexing]
* Refer to xref:search/index.adoc#algolia[`docs/search/README.adoc`] for the Algolia procedure until we automate crawls.
* Run `make mcp-dev` to expose the docs MCP server locally and experiment with agent retrieval.

== Legacy imports

Converted guides live under directories that mirror their original Markdown paths, e.g.
`xref:++1. Cerebrum Docs/README.adoc++[]`. Continue editing Markdown until each team is
ready to fully author in AsciiDoc.
