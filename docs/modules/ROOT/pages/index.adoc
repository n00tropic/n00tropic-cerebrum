The n00 Cerebrum super-repo owns the Antora playbook for every sibling
workspace. Each submodule exposes its docs component via the shared build so
contributors can reason about projects, automations, and runbooks from one
location.

== Living snippets

[source,shell]
----
include::example$scripts/erpnext-run.sh[tags=snippet-erpnext-run]
----

Because snippets are tagged in-source they stay evergreen whenever tests update the files that own the truth.

== Search and automation workflows

* xref:search/index.adoc[Search + indexing]
* Refer to xref:search/index.adoc#Algolia[] for the Algolia procedure until automation covers crawls.
* Run `make mcp-dev` to expose the docs MCP server locally and experiment with agent retrieval through the MCP host.

== Legacy imports

Converted guides live under directories that mirror their original Markdown paths, for example
xref:++1. Cerebrum Docs/README.adoc++[]. Continue editing Markdown until each team is
ready to fully author in asciidoc.
