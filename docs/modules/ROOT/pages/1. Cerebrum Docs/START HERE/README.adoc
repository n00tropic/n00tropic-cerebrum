This repository records cross-workspace decisions, shared policy, and release
manifests. Treat it as the governance layer for the polyrepo.

== If you only have 5 minutes

* Read xref:../README.adoc[`README.md`] for the current doc structure.
* Check `ADR/` for recent architecture decisions; every cross-repository change should
 reference an ADR here.
* Review `RENOVATE_SETUP.md` and `TRUNK_GUIDE.md` when adjusting dependency or
 linting policies.
== Quick start (humans)

[,bash]
----
cd "1. Cerebrum Docs" pnpm install --prefix ../n00-cortex docs # optional: reuse
Docusaurus tooling

# Lint markdown and front matter
trunk check --filter markdownlint-cli2

# Generate release snapshot (from workspace root)
../.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-release.sh

== Key directories

|=== | Path | Purpose

| `ADR/` | Canonical architecture decision records.

| `releases.yaml` | Workspace release log written by automation.

| `RENOVATE_SETUP.md` | Guidance on shared Renovate presets and onboarding.

| `TRUNK_GUIDE.md` | Describes Trunk usage across repos. |===

== Contribution guardrails

* Number ADRs sequentially and keep titles descriptive. Link back to repo-specific
 ADRs or PRs.
* Update `releases.yaml` via automation scripts, not manual edits.
* When introducing new workspace policy, document the process change here first,
 then reference it from other repositories' `START HERE` guides.
