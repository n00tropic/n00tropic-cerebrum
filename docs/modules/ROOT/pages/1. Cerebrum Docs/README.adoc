This directory captures workspace-level knowledge that sits above any single
repository. Use it to document governance, cross-repo automation, and decisions
that affect multiple generators at once.

== Using This Folder

. *Workspace ADRs* -- Store cross-cutting architectural decisions under `ADR/`.
Follow the naming pattern `ADR-XXX-title.md` (three-digit sequence). . *Indexes*
-- Reference repository-specific ADR indices when a decision spans multiple
repos so readers know where to dive deeper. . *Local Guidance* -- Add any future
quick-start guides, release checklists, or workspace automation notes here
instead of the individual repos. . *Release Manifests* -- `releases.yaml` is
generated by `../.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-release.sh` and tracks the
tags bundled into the latest workspace drop. . *Toolchain Notes* -- When
runtimes change, capture the decision here and update
`../n00-cortex/data/toolchain-manifest.json` alongside affected ADRs.
