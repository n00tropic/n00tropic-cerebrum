This directory captures workspace-level knowledge that spans more than any single
repository. Use it to document governance, cross-repository automation, and decisions
that affect multiple generators at once.

== Using this folder

. *Workspace ADRs* -- Store cross-cutting architectural decisions under `ADR/`
and follow the naming pattern `ADR-XXX-title.adoc` (three-digit sequence).
. *Indexes* -- Reference repository-specific ADR indices when a decision spans
multiple repositories so readers know where to dive deeper.
. *Local Guidance* -- Add any future quick start guides, release checklists, or
workspace automation notes here instead of the individual repositories.
. *Release Manifests* -- `releases.yaml` is generated by
`../.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-release.sh` and tracks the tags bundled
into the latest workspace drop.
. *Toolchain Notes* -- When runtime requirements change, capture the decision
here and update the Toolchain manifest at
`../n00-cortex/data/toolchain-manifest.json` alongside affected ADRs.

Keep the documentation concise and avoid duplicating material maintained inside
the individual repositories.
