AI assistants (and ephemeral automation sessions) frequently attach to this
filesystem after the human operator has already been iterating. The notes below
make it trivial to recover context, detect the active repository, and tidy up
submodules or untracked files before attempting an automation run.

== Workspace topology

* *Super root*: `/Volumes/APFS Space/n00tropic/` (intentionally not a git repository).
 It houses the federated `n00tropic-cerebrum/` repository, the operational archive in
 `n00tropic_HQ/`, and shared automation under `.dev/`.
* *Primary git workspace*: `/Volumes/APFS Space/n00tropic/n00tropic-cerebrum/`
 with submodules for `n00t/`, `n00-frontiers/`, `n00-cortex/`, etc.
* *Automation scripts*: tracked inside
 `n00tropic-cerebrum/.dev/automation/scripts/`. Anything under the outer `.dev/`
 directory mirrors to local environments but isn't versioned.
== Identify your repository

____ ✅ When in doubt, run the script below -- it enumerates the workspace root
plus every submodule. ____

[,bash]
----
./.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-health.sh --publish-artifact
----

* Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from any path to confirm which repository you are
 in.
* The script writes `artifacts/workspace-health.json`, which automation clients can parse to
 decide which submodule needs attention and whether the workspace root is
 ahead/behind origin.
== Sanity checks & auto remediation

|=== | Need | Command | Notes

| Snapshot workspace + publish machine-readable status |
`./.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-health.sh --publish-artifact --json` | JSON
goes to stdout *and* `artifacts/workspace-health.json`.

| Clean only-untracked noise (for example generated assets) without touching tracked work |
`./.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-health.sh --clean-untracked` | Runs `git
 clean -fd` for repositories that have no tracked changes.

| Realign submodule pointers | `./.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-health.sh
--sync-submodules` | Equivalent to `git submodule sync && git submodule update
--init --recursive`.

| Run everything (submodules + trunk sync) |
`./.dev/automation/scripts/workspace-health.sh --fix-all` | Alias for the
previous two steps.

| Strict ci-style enforcement | Append `--strict-submodules --strict-root` |
Causes a non-zero exit when anything is dirty/diverged. |===

== Workspace git doctor capability

* The capability manifest now exposes the script described earlier at `workspace.gitDoctor`.
 It honours the following payload keys when invoked via the n00t automation runner
 or MCP host: ** `cleanUntracked` → toggles `--clean-untracked`. **
 `syncSubmodules` → toggles `--sync-submodules`. ** `publishArtifact` → writes
 the JSON file to `artifacts/workspace-health.json`. ** `strict`/`check` →
 mirrors the command-line tool `--strict` flag for ci checks.
* Results are persisted automatically when the runner sets
 `CAPABILITY_PAYLOAD.output`, so automation clients always have a JSON artefact to inspect
 after the run.
=== Sample MCP payload

[,json]
----
{ "cleanUntracked": true, "syncSubmodules": true, "publishArtifact": true,
"strict": false
}
----

== Handling dirty states before push

. *Root shows tracked changes to a submodule* (`workspace-health` prints
`+tracked 1 … n00t+`): ** Inspect the repository: `git -C n00t status -sb`. **
Commit/push inside the submodule if the change is intentional, then commit the
pointer change at the root. ** Otherwise run `git submodule update --init
--recursive` to reset to the recorded revision.
. *Root shows untracked files only*: ** Use `--clean-untracked` (safe, because it skips repositories with tracked
changes).
. *Submodule behind/ahead*: ** `git -C <repository> pull --ff-only` or `git
-C <repository> push --force-with-lease` depending on the direction.

TIP: the JSON artifact exposes `tracked` vs `untracked` arrays per repository, so an
automation run can branch its remediation strategy programmatically.

== Automation-friendly checklist

. `workspace-health.sh --publish-artifact --json`. . Read
`artifacts/workspace-health.json` to determine the active repository + remediation
path. . Run guarded cleaners (`--clean-untracked`) or `--sync-submodules` as
needed. . When invoked via MCP, prefer `workspace.gitDoctor` so the host
automatically records the output path.

Following the preceding loop removes the guesswork around submodules, untracked
files, and root vs submodule context before automation tries to run.
