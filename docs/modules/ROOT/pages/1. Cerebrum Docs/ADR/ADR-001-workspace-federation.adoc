= ADR-001: Federated Generator Workspace

== Status

Accepted -- 2025-11-04

== Context

The n00tropic platform relies on a collection of repositories, many of which
feed the generator system that scaffolds downstream customer projects. A full
monorepo would simplify certain tooling, but it brings real risks:

* Large generator surfaces (Python CLI, pnpm apps, documentation sites,
 operational playbooks) would be coupled. A single failing toolchain could block
 all pipelines.
* Generators consume tagged releases from multiple repos. Co-locating everything
 makes it easier to accidentally commit experimental tooling or local artefacts
 that then leak into generated projects.
* Each repository has distinct governance (ownership teams, release cadences, ci
 workflows). A monorepo complicates CODEOWNERS and permissions.
* Contributors would need to install every runtime just to make a small change in
 one area.
At the same time, contributors need a reliable map so they can make cross-Repo
changes safely and confidently.

== Decision

Maintain a federated workspace with shared documentation and governance at the
root level.

. Keep the existing repositories (`n00-frontiers`, `n00-cortex`, `n00t`,
`n00tropic`, `n00plicate`) independent with their own ci and release flows. .
Provide a workspace map and coordination guardrails in `README` at the root of
the filesystem. . Store cross-Repo ADRs and process notes in `1. Cerebrum
Docs/` so decisions that impact generators are traceable without polluting any
single repo. . Reference repository-specific ADR indices instead of duplicating
their content. Workspace ADRs should link to those indices when a decision spans
multiple repos. . Enforce separation of concerns: generated artefacts,
experimental code, and repo-specific caches must never be committed across Repo
boundaries.

== Consequences

* Positive: Each stack stays lean and can evolve at its own pace.
* Positive: Workspace decisions are recorded centrally without breaking repo-level
 history or generator outputs.
* Positive: Downstream generators continue to point at tagged releases, reducing
 the risk of accidental contamination.
* Negative: Cross-Repo work still requires coordination and multiple PRs.
 Contributors must follow the workflow documented in the root README.
* Negative: Shared tooling (for example, a combined superlinter) needs glue
 scripts instead of living inside a single ci pipeline.
== Implementation Notes

* Populate the root README with the workspace atlas, generator boundaries, and
 contribution workflow (completed alongside this ADR).
* Keep `1. Cerebrum Docs/README.md` up to date so new contributors know where to
 add workspace-level documentation.
* When a decision affects generator contracts (manifest formats, release tagging
 rules), add a new ADR in this folder and link it from the relevant Repo
 documentation.
== Follow-up Questions

* Should we add an automated "workspace smoke test" script that shells into each
 Repo and runs its primary health check?
* Do we need a signed release manifest so generators can verify inputs across
 repositories?
* How should we surface the status of pending cross-Repo work (issue tracker vs.
 docs site vs. dashboards)?
