= Renovate Setup

All repositories now inherit dependency policy from the shared preset published
in `n00tropic-cerebrum/renovate/presets/workspace.json`. To keep hosted Renovate
aligned:

. *Self-hosted or GitHub App* ** Ensure the bot has read access to
`n00tropic-cerebrum`. ** Update the global configuration (or onboarding preset)
to extend
`github>IAmJonoBo/n00tropic-cerebrum//renovate/presets/workspace.json`. **
Remove legacy `config:base` or workspace-specific overrides unless they are
still required. . *Enterprise mirrors* ** If outbound GitHub downloads are
blocked, mirror `n00tropic-cerebrum/renovate/presets/workspace.json` to an
internal repository. ** Replace the `github>` reference with your internal
mirror (for example, `local>renovate-presets/workspace.json`). . *Verification*
** After updating the preset, trigger Renovate manually on `n00-frontiers` and
`n00plicate`. ** Confirm the dashboard PR reflects the new preset and grouped
rules.

Downstream repositories should not redefine high-level scheduling or semantic
commit behaviour; keep adjustments minimal (for example, package-specific
automerge rules).

== Integrating Additional Tooling

* *pip-tools (`pip-compile`)* -- Generate deterministic `requirements.txt` files;
  configure Renovate `postUpgradeTasks` to run `pip-compile` for Python projects.
* *pip-audit / Safety* -- Add to CI pipelines (for example via
  `.dev/automation/scripts/meta-check.sh`) to block merges when known CVEs exist.
* *Node lockfiles* -- Ensure `package-lock.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml` are committed so
  Renovate upgrades stay reproducible.
* *Custom dashboards* -- Use Renovate's dependency dashboard or consume data from
  the Renovate API to track stale upgrades across repos.
