# Coding Standards

- **Clarity beats cleverness.** Name things like you mean it.
- **DRY:** one source of truth; refactor duplication on sight.
- **YAGNI:** implement today’s needs; design for tomorrow.
- Language‑specific style guides (link here).
- Error handling, logging, and input validation are part of the design.
- Public APIs are documented and versioned (SemVer).

## Commit & PR discipline

- Conventional Commits; small PRs; checklist completed.
