# Frontier Web App Template

A comprehensive, framework-agnostic web development scaffold optimised for modern web applications (SPA/SSR/ISR/Edge). It’s intentionally broad; remove what you don’t need.

## Highlights

- **Contracts-first** (`/api`): OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and protobufs.
- **Web app essentials** (`/apps/web`): accessible, performant, PWA-ready (manifest, service worker), SEO & social cards, i18n, testing (unit + E2E), and CI (Lighthouse CI).
- **Ops & Security**: security headers/CSP patterns, performance budgets, and runbooks.
- **Infra**: IaC, container, and deploy pipelines (provider-agnostic).

See `docs/` for rationale and links to standards.
